This is Dan Cardamore's blog where I'll cover technology topics such as devops, kubernetes, golang and web technologies.  I'll probably cover a few other topics I'm interested in also.

If you have any questions you can reach me on twitter: [@dancardamore](https://twitter.com/dancardamore) or send me an email dan @ hld.ca
